# Brain Hemorrhage Detection using Deep Learning

## üß† **Why is Brain Hemorrhage Detection Important?**
Brain hemorrhages, often caused by trauma, aneurysms, or high blood pressure, are life-threatening conditions that require immediate attention. Accurate and timely detection can significantly improve patient outcomes, reducing morbidity and mortality.

---

## üöÄ **Project Overview**
This project leverages cutting-edge AI techniques to detect and classify brain hemorrhages from medical imaging (e.g., CT scans). By fine-tuning a pretrained **ResNet-18** model, we achieve reliable classification of hemorrhage types and severity levels, aiding clinicians in making faster and more informed decisions.

## üåü **Key Features**
- **Non-Invasive Detection**: Analyzes CT scan images for rapid diagnosis without invasive procedures.
- **ResNet-18 Backbone**: Fine-tuned for precise classification and detection of brain hemorrhages.
- **Comprehensive Analysis Tools**: Integrated **confusion matrix**, **ROC curve**, and **training vs. validation accuracy plots** for performance evaluation.
- **Data Augmentation**: Improves accuracy by handling class imbalance and enhancing feature extraction.
